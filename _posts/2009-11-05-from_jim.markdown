I am of the least notable writers to have taught English as a second language, beginning in Japan in 1999 and rising from *eikaiwa* (English language schools) to the ESL Institute at the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse. At that time, I had a short correspondence with poet Jim Harrison, who mentioned his own language-teaching experience:  

*Dear Adam,*  

*I hope I don’t run on at the mouth, but if you’re in La Crosse half the year I think you’ll probably like it. I used to go there occasionally to work or for R & R from Michigan, because I liked to sit at a motel desk and look at the river, and look at pretty things like an eagle tearing into a duck that was half frozen in the ice.*  

*I was an abject failure at teaching English as a second language in grad school. In one class I had 23 nationality groups, all of whom had studied English, but I couldn’t understand anyone.*  

*Yrs., Jim*  

Once opposed to the idea of teaching, especially teaching writing, Harrison became more forgiving over the years to those who had to make a living. Having gone to school with a varied group of people and lived abroad over half of my life, I am not as bad off as Harrison was when it comes to understanding speakers of English as a second language. I am just as much at home talking with a Nigerian as I am a Chinese. The beauty of language is that it is imperfect and not mathematical. The beauty of English is that it belongs not to one country but to those who chose to make it their own.
