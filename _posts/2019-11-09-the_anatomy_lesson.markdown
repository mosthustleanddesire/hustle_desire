*A photograph from a [blog post][post-link] in a series on the physician assistant model. Working on this and in other media forms, I have come to find any word art--essay, poem or documentary--though categorically apart are anatomically alike, cut as they are from the same stuff of life. In particular, the bodiless voice, the Beckett-like rambling of the earthbound storyteller, has always been so vital, so much poetry.*
