*An image of* The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicoleas Tulp *by Rembrandt used for a [blog post][post-link] in a series on the physician-assistant model. Working on this and in other media forms, I have come to find any word art--poem, essay or documentary--though categorically apart are anatomically alike, cut as they are from the bodiless voice, the Beckett-like yammering of the earthbound storyteller.*
