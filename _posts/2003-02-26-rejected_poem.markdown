*Though the in-fine-feather Heather McHugh spoke highly of this poem, "a KNOCK-OUT" and "one of your very best â€“ doesn't need a lick of change," it was turned down once more April 2, 2019, again with little clue as to why, sixteen years after its composition:

"Dear Adam Halbur,

Thank you for giving the editorial board a chance to read your poetry. Unfortunately, we will not be accepting 'Prayer for the Tortoise' for publication at this time.

We hope you understand that a rejection is not necessarily a reflection on the quality of your work; in fact, many factors come into consideration throughout the selection process. Due to the voluntary nature of this board and the sheer volume of unsolicited submissions we receive each year, we are unable to provide a detailed critique for you at this time. Nevertheless, we never wish to discourage poets and writers, so please keep writing and submitting!

Feel free to contact us with any questions, and many thanks, again, for considering our magazine.

Yours truly,

The Editorial Team"*
