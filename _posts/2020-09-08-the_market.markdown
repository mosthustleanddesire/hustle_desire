*I was asked to give feedback in the editing of a documentary sponsored by the Japanese government, an intimate introduction to a Cypriot marketplace with a Polish journalist and a Japanese filmmaker:* [ニコシアのバザール][bazaar-link]. *During the process, I couldn't help feel a certain longing for my own jaunts through European open markets, the Marché biologique Raspail in the winter of 2010, the Osrednja ljubljanska tržnica in the summer of 2016, and the Rotterdam Centrum Market in the summer of 2017, pictured below.*
