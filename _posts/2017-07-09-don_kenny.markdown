*A still from [my first attempt at documentary][first-attempt]. The sound and picture leave much to be desired, but I am satisfied with the overall form the piece took while editing and my efforts restoring photographs, like the above.*  Don Kenny *is a comedic study of character – on and off the stage, in front of and behind the mask – of a man who lived it up in the boom of post-war Tokyo, from interviewing Judi Dench to going to bed with Yukio Mishima.*
