But we still had Eddie,  
part Golden Retriever. Ginger  
taught him good manners. Eddie, the wolf dog,
howls at coyotes. Eddie, the mutt,  
pisses on Dad's pine seedlings. Eddie, the faker,  
plays dead to a finger pistol  
and *Bang*. Eddie, the laggard, naps on the country road,  
on winter afternoons. Eddie,  
run over today, lies split,  
in the gut in the garage  
in January. Eddie,  
stupid dog.
