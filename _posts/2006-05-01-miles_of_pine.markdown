"...built of two miles of white pine..."  

---------------------------

*The only words I remember from an audit of a high-value home, a house worth anywhere from $500,000 into the millions. The new 5000+ square-foot home with floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace and three-car garage in one of the poorer counties of northern Wisconsin, a state in which over 30 percent of households are renters, was an urbanite's vacation retreat. Perhaps the owner was trying to emulate the lumber robber barons of old.*
