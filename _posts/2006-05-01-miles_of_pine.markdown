"...built of two miles of white pine..."  

---------------------------

*The only words I remember from an audit of a high-value home, a house worth anywhere from $500,000 into the millions. The new 5000+ square-foot home with floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace and three-car garage in Wisconsin. In the time of the lumber robber barons of the 1800s, "[t]he amount of pine harvested from the Black River Valley alone," according to the Wisconsin Historical Society [website][website-link]," could have built a boardwalk nine feet wide and four inches thick around the entire world." What would it have been like to walk beneath those 300-year-old trees?*
