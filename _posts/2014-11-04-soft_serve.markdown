title: "Elegy for a Soft Serve Machine"
author: Adam Halbur
---

Finished chanting their shanties,  
and sandbags full, the fishermen  
light cigarettes, crack soft drinks,  
and harass the pretty volunteer  
before we go to comb the coast  
for odd bits of village debris  
strewn by the 30-foot tsunami,  
like this soft serve machine, sucked  
from the seaside hotel and dumped  
where the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s  
Witnesses no longer stands. This  
stainless steel wreck is today  
while tomorrow is the girl running  
ahead of the funeral procession,  
sticking in her mouth the green  
seed pods of wisteria we’ve cut  
from a *katsura* tree. The adults wait  
for us to clear the way as they cling  
to portraits of the man and woman  
filling urns they carry to the grave.  
It’s a sunny day, perfect for harvesting  
scallops, crabs and sea cucumbers  
and for licking soft serve to the sigh  
of waves rising and falling past  
the shoreline pines, where fishermen  
smoke their last and chuck  
crumpled packs to the blue of the bay.
