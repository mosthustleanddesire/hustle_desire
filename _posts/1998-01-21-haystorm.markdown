1. storm  

	A number of fortune seekers, shoots frosted in shrouds of rime, are going to storm
	the "Peak" this spring. From our prairie shores a line of hay-capped wagons extend past
	the dead burr oak. Hair swirls around necks like anklets of chaff. Prairie fires all around.
	There is a brilliant one in the East now. Black-legs, Thieves, and Land Pirates fan
	the flame.  

	A few with capital energy and Iron constitution may make it but they will lose money,
	health and character. The sudden wealth of one in a hundred or a thousand, masses
	of folks to beg bread. The oxen meander. The hopeful seek not to follow in the footsteps
	of the people of old. They seek what they sought.  

2. trivialities  

	I turned the spyglass on our farm. To see it from Pemberton's is like looking back on a life
	we once knew. When I call to mind my earliest impressions, I wonder
	whether the process ordinarily referred to as growing up is not actually a process
	of growing down.  

	The boys John and Parker saw a bird fly off the fence. Toward Webster City they look,
	wishing to sack it for treasures and carry off the holy. Pa gave them a gun and they came
	home with six prairie hens. James joined the 21st Alabama. The neck tie he sent John is
	a great invention. Why did we not think of it?  

	A family headed for Pikes Peak sold their song, a mahogany Melodeon. On the Sabbath
	our hay-maid, Bella, plays "The Willow Song" and the "Fisher's Hornpipe" upon
	its swollen keys. Pa and John cut trees for firewood down by the sleepless creek, dried up
	by summer.  

3. harvest  

	A party of Indians – three squaws, the chief, eleven male followers – passed, intelligent
	looking, and reasonably clean and neat. They had been up above Fort Dodge putting up
	hay and preparing to spend the winter.  

	One hundred and twenty tons of hay. The children get tired from outdoor work; Bella
	looks forward to grammar school.  

	A dry snow commenced falling. It keltered on the frozen hills. There was some lightening
	indicating heavy rain south of us and were it not for the drifting, I prefer the snow
	decidedly. I doubt whether it is possible for the earth to be so productive where
	the winters are short. The Gold must be tried in the fire before it is pronounced virgin.  

	Numbers returning from Pikes Peak disappointed, sick, some left sleeping in the snow
	hay-bearded, huddled under sows, stormed, groveled in sties. No manna,
	only stones. A sigh can break a man in two.  

4. hey-time  

	The best way of commemorating the dead is by finding some amusement and ceasing
	your grieving. During hey-time we dance a country dervish to a harvest moon,  

	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
	How that a life was but, a flower.  

	In the night sun, a fatted cow bleeds along a hedge row.

*A poem written as an undergrad that used other sources as material, namely* This State of Wonders: Letters of an Iowa Frontier Family, 1858-1861. *I also inserted quotes from "The Rustic Gate" by Matsuo Basho, Adol Leopold's* A Sand County Almanac, *the Talmud,* Letters of Hideyoshi *and William Shakespeare's "It was a lover and his lass." The [map][map-link] of Iowa above is from* Colton's rail-road and military map of the United States, Mexico, the West Indies, &c. *(1860). With the Sioux, Pottawatomi and Fox and Sac already dispossessed of their lands through "treaties," in the next ten to twenty years all of Iowa would be settled, including by own Westphalian ancestor who had worked farms in eastern Iowa during the Civil War. After the war, the railroads passed [Homer][homer-link] by, and so it disappeared, unlike Halbur, Iowa. It should be noted that while someone joins the Confederate military in the poem, from the 1830s through 1850s parts of the [Underground Railroad][underground-link] ran through and south of the Homer region, very much at the crossroads of American history.*
