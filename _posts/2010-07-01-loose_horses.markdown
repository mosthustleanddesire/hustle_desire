title: "Loose Horses"
author: Adam Halbur
---

Busting through a 30 below wind-chill,  
they stretch the distance,  
hooves throwing snow, nostrils  
flaring, manes shaking loose. Until  
at the abandoned road, they brake:  
fences nowhere.

*This is from my book of poems [Poor Manners][poor-link], which I sent to Jim Harrison. He wrote back October 29, 2009, "Dear Adam Halbur, After six months of drafting a novel I sorted the piles of mumble-jumble on my desk and uncovered your wonderful book of poems which at first intrigued me of my Swede immigrant relatives who farmed in Mecosta County. The poems are on the money as they say. I go to drown in often unpleasant memories. I note that you are in Japan?  Always wondered why they are frightened of garlic? --Yrs. Jim"*  

*I also sent the book to my much admired mentor Heather McHugh who emailed back January 24, 2010, "I didn't get the book--not sure why--I've been all over the map--" which made me laugh as according to her wit you could take this comment at least one of two ways.*  

*In a review, Susan Rich writes on her [blog][rich-link] June 7, 2010, "I didn't expect to like it based on the title but was utterly surprised by its mix of humor and pathos."*  

*The best compliment was from an inebriated vagrant who walked into a poetry reading in Denver, Colorado on April 10, 2010. He said, and I quote, "Right on, man," which I took as license to "write on."
