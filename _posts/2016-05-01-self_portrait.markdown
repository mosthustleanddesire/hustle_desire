“There might’ve been a few that could’ve you know  
because I’ve been attacked by one  
I know what it means to have someone come at me  
with their hands like this ready to get at my face  
because some of them had come  
all the way from Mexico and El Salvador and spent  
three months traveling and some had done that  
one woman from Guatemala had done that  
three times and brought her whole family up  
she had been married and the guy was a drunk  
so she decided to make for herself a life and she  
she was picked up by border agents once but uh  
another woman who made her way it took her months  
and when she came she had this child  
and to talk about what people will do to try to better their life  
but here was this woman she would hold  
this baby and this little girl would reach  
into her blouse and try to nurse because she was so  
you know and she had this big pot belly full of  
parasites and the hair streaked with brown  
you know right away she was suffering such malnutrition so  
so I would sleep with them overnight at the shelter  
at least one of us sisters did  
because we got a real feel for their needs  
the needs of the women and what was going on  
in their lives and I would say it was a good  
experience but it wasn’t always easy you know  
because I had to lay down the law or how  
should I say I think I was a real demon at times  
and still they you know”
