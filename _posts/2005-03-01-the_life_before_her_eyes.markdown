"You couldn't remember summer and not remember roses..."  

------------------------
*An excerpt from Laura Kasischke's* The Life Before Her Eyes,「春に葬られた光」*, or* The Light Buried in Spring *in Japanese, for which I served as consultant. Translation is a process that brings together many minds, not only requiring us to look through the characters' eyes but across cultural readings, placing the novel not in the original or in the translation but between the two.*
