*For the poet, there is often more interest to be found in the cadence and connotations of human speech than in music's reassuring rhythms and rhymes. This, however, is as much bane as boon without the resources to work a subject's ramblings into an entertaining and accomplished form.*  

*In June 2019, I returned to Africa, to Kenya, to film the clinical officer. Not only for charity, as an unpaid historian for this profession. But also for myself, to make a better documentary. Despite promises made, my professed collaborator had other plans, making me volunteer to his personal ambitions while stonewalling my ideas for a video. I went to school with kids from tough neighborhoods of Chicago and New Orleans who imbued me with a sense of street smarts, but this was a crash course refresher.*  

*Of the clinical officers interviewed, Mzee Isaac Nunda, who began practicing in 1958 and helped to pass the Clinical Officers Act of 1988, was one of the more interesting. His drive, though self-aggrandizing at times, was to the immediate benefit of others in his profession. Some of those who followed immediately in his footsteps seem much less called to the profession, desiring more the status of higher degrees and financial prowess. Two COs of such ilk openly mocked a talented colleague who had lost everything trying to start a hospital and had fallen to drink.*  

*I chose Nunda for his character and setting and edited with few omissions:* [Mzee: An Old Kenyan Clinical Officer][mzee-link]. *As a work of oral history, it is another success, but as a work of truth-telling, it still falls short. I can only take courage from this diehard and keep on keeping on. The truth is there waiting to be cut from hours of turns of phrase and facial expressions.*
