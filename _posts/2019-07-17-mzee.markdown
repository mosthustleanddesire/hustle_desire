*For the poet, there is more comfort to be found in the varied cadence and connotations of human speech than in music's redundant rhythms and rhymes. This, however, is as much bane as boon without the resources to work a subject's ramblings into an entertaining and accomplished form.  

In June 2019, I returned to Africa, to Kenya, to film the clinical officer. Not for charity, as an unpaid historian for this profession. But to make a better documentary. Unfortunately, my "collaborator" had other plans, making me volunteer to his personal ambitions while stonewalling my efforts to salvage a video.  

There is nothing intelligent or interesting in sidelining others to one's self-importance. It's simply uninspiring and sad. Even the professed champion of PAs, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, declined to offer token funding for my Kenya project or simple assistance to promote to their members a finished film championing PA-like professionals around the world. Truly uninspiring, to say the least.  

Of the clinical officers interviewed, Mzee Isaac Nunda, who began practicing in 1958 and helped to pass the Clinical Officers Act of 1988, was one of the more inspiring. His drive was to the benefit of future generations. In turn, however, some of these seem much less called to the profession, desiring more the status of higher degrees and financial prowess. Two COs of such ilk openly mocked a talented colleague who had lost everything trying to start a hospital and had fallen to drink. How sad, indeed.  

Out of hours of interviews of old COs, I chose this one for its setting and characters and edited it with few omissions:* [Mzee: An Old Clinical Officer][mzee-link]. *As a work of anthropology, it is a great success, but a work of art it is not. I can only take courage from Mzee and keep on keeping on.*
