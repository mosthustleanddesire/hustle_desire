If you don’t like solitude, don’t be a writer.  But even if you like solitude, you should like people because they’re people and you need something to write about.  Plenty of people stop to see the museum in the house, shop in the barn, or walk the newly restored poetry trail.  They’ll be sure to sit on your front porch describing the mountains in adjectives even you wouldn’t use: beautiful, stunning, marvelous, gorgeous, majestic, something else.  And they’ll say how inspiring it must be to write here.

Then, a woman will read the sign out front, making a general announcement to all within earshot:  “1 to 5 p.m. (except Tuesdays). At other times, if you walk the grounds, please respect the concentration of the resident poet living and working in this house.”  
And a man will answer: “There’s a what?”  
Woman: “A poet.”  
Man: “A poet?”  
Woman: (Raising the volume of her voice) “It says here, ‘please respect the concentration of the resident poet living and working in this house.’”  
Man: (Looking in the window where you sit typing) “I don’t see anyone.”  
Woman: “Well, it says right here.”  

And you’ll hear this conversation many times and not be noticed by many people.

*An excerpt from a piece I wrote this day at [The Frost Place][frost-link] and titled "Letter to a Poet," later published at* [Verse Wisconsin][verse-link] *and in* [Local Ground(s): Midwest Poetics][cowfeather-link].  

*While I was resident here for a modest collection of poems,* [Poor Manners][poor-link], *the place has hosted extraordinary writers from [Katha Pollitt][pollitt-link] and [Robert Hass][hass-link] to [Laura Kasischke][kasischke-link] and [Major Jackson][major-link].*  

*I also got to hang with some other contemporary mothers of verse: [John Murillo][murillo-link], [Greg Pardlo][pardlo-link] and [Blas Falconer][blas-link].*
