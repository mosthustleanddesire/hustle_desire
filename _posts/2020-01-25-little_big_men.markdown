*After overcoming initial frustration and months of transcribing, researching, reflecting and forgetting, I have cut a historical documentary following the common thread of the material captured in June 2019:* [Little Big Men: the Rise of Kenya's Clinical Officer][men-link]. *The struggle of Kenya's clinical officer for legal recognition is a microcosm of Kenyan politics past and present, in which "big men" have traditionally dominated the field. This "Wild West" story captures infighting, favoritism, personal determination and gifts of appreciation, if not bribes. I was lucky to be allowed access to the CO story and their extraordinary lives.*
