*For Mikhail Bakhmetiev*  

On the green, in the clearing,  
in the middle of the street,  
walk Steshas, walk Glanyas,  
ruddy wild hens.  

Like roosters Vankas,  
Stepkas strut in pomp,  
their snub-nosed ensnaring faces  
so sweetly skinned.  

Aiming a clumsy claw  
to paw a boob,  
grins the roly-poly  
cripple Mitka.  

The redhead on accordion jerks the bellows,  
the wenches squawk in chorus,  
setting off on a ditty about Yermoshka.  
The wheat is getting high.

*The poem is translated from Andrei Platonov's* Blue Depths, *part three. And the drawing below was done by Edward Frederick Ertz (1862-1954), a relative who was an artist of the Romantic era, the period which influenced young Platonov's poetry.*
