a hay rake with its hand-hewn teeth  
pulled and a vodka bottle emptied  
of its drug. Rain is blowing down  
from the Altai and beats the sides  
of a pup tent two Kazakh boys  
entangle beneath. The camel herd  
with humps erect stands wet  
in the dark. Lightening strikes,  
thunder rolls, and their dog with a  
lion's main whimpers and moans.  
The dampened air is perfumed  
with mown grass and warm manure.
