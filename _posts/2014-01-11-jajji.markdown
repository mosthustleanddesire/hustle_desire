*Generation after generation is enamored of being in the movies. My mother's father often recounted how as a U.S. Marine munitions expert at Camp Pendleton, California, he set up the beach-scene explosions for* Sands of Iwo Jima *(1949), seen at the end of this [trailer][iwo-link] in which he is off camera pushing buttons. My first chance came as an extra in* [ジャッジ!][judge-link] *(pronounced "jajji," meaning "judge"), in which I screwed up a shot by walking between the camera and the actors Satoshi Tsumabuki and Keiko Kitagawa. As I participated in the closing scenes with an eclectic mix of foreigners who had been bussed from Tokyo to the set at a desolate seaside resort on the Boso Peninsula, it all seemed an ill-conceived cheering-up centered around the promotion of a fish product following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and 2011 earthquake strangely referred to as "3/11." The main character (Tsumabuki) wins an ad competition under the paternal-like assurances of a U.S. contest judge played by James C. Burns. It's as if the Japanese celebrities that heavily populate this movie are gritting their teeth, grinning and bearing it. But I'll let the viewer be the judge of that.*
