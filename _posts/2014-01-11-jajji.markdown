*Generation after generation is enamored of being in the movies. My mother's father often recounted how as a U.S. Marine munitions expert at Camp Pendleton, California, he set up the beach-scene explosions for* Sands of Iwo Jima *(1949), seen at the end of this [trailer][iwo-link] in which he is off camera pushing buttons. My own chance came as an extra in* [ジャッジ!][judge-link] *(pronounced "jajji," meaning "judge"), in which I screwed up a shot by walking between the camera and the actors Satoshi Tsumabuki and Keiko Kitagawa. As I participated in the closing scenes with an eclectic mix of foreigners who had been bussed from Tokyo to the set at a desolate seaside resort on the Boso Peninsula, it all seemed an ill-conceived kamikazi-like promotion of a fish product following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, strangely referred to as "3/11," but I'll let the viewer be the judge of that.*
