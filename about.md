In high school, I called Lester Contreras 'offense' for his speed and skill at forward, and he called me, the stopper, 'defense' since I worked like the Energizer Bunny to get the ball and get it back to him, despite the fact I had never played soccer before.  Most Hustle & Desire is an honorific given to someone who headlong follows his passion with all his capacity while his skill struggles to keep up.  *-Adam Halbur*
