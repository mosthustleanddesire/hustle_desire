I called Lester Contreras 'offense' for his speed and skill at forward, and he called me, the stopper, 'defense' since I never quit trying to get the ball and get it back to him, despite the fact I had never played soccer before. Most Hustle & Desire is an honorific given to someone who jumps in headlong with all his capacity for the love of it.  *-Adam Halbur*
